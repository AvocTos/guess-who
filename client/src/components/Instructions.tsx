Each player will randomly receive a card.<br></br>The objective of the game is to be the first to determine which card one's opponent has. Players alternate either guessing a candidate or asking various yes or no questions to eliminate candidates, such as:<br></br><br></br>

      "Does your person wear a hat?"<br></br>
      "Does your person wear glasses?"<br></br>
      "Is your person a man?"<br></br><br></br>
      The player will then eliminate candidates (based on the opponent's response) by clicking those images off. Well-crafted questions allow players to eliminate one or more possible cards.</p>
